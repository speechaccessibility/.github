# Speech Accessibility Project

Artificial intelligence and machine learning allow people to use speech recognition, such as voice assistants or translation tools, to operate technology using their voices. Speech recognition is powered by machine learning; without diverse, representative data, ML models cannot learn how to understand a diversity of speech. This project aims to change that by creating the dataset needed to more effectively train these machine learning models.

The Speech Accessibility Project will collect speech samples from individuals representing a diversity of speech patterns. UIUC researchers will recruit paid volunteers to contribute recorded voice samples and will create a private, de-identified dataset which can be used to train machine learning models to better understand a variety of speech patterns.

All software created by the Speech Accessibility Project will be released open-source, in the repositories of this github organization.
